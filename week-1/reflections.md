#1.1 Think About Time

Pomodoro Technique

The pomodoro technique describes 25 minute time slots designated to very specific tasks and aims to eliminate distractions from that time. Instead of spending a lot of time or a difficult task you spend more focused time and a shorter period of time on one thing allowing you to learn and retain more information. The pomodoro technique describes how we are only able to focus for a period of time and after about 25 minutes we need to get up an take a 5 minute break.

Time boxing is specifically scheduling events during a certain time in order to make sure that you accomplish all your goals on time. Something like calendaring. In phase 0 you can use time boxing so that you can get through all of your work. I think that it would be most effective to preview the work first so maybe time box that portion and then figure out which portions of the unit will require more time.

I currently manage my time with my google calendar and a checklist. I set reminders on my phone when things are due, and I set out at least 1.5 hours a day for work so during this time I check the online portal to see what I need to look and spend some time on.

My current strategy is working but I think that I need to separate my goals. I have so many short term and long term goals that I need to make enough time to get everything done. Because I have so many things that I want to do, many times I feel like I am spread thin and am not able to sink deep enough into one things.

I am going to attempt to implement the pomodoro technique by breaking down the topics and spending 25 minutes on the subtopics, taking a 5 minute break and then moving onto the next topic. This way I am able to at least review and become familiar with a concept and if I need more time to understand it I can come back later.

#1.2 The Command Line

1. Shell is the user interface whether this is command line of GUI, BASH is the POSIX command line language in sorts

2. The most challenging part was learning new commands and understanding the option -p or |  the basic commands were easier to understand.

3. I was pretty much able to use all of the command but it took a few tries and a little time for some of them to sink in. I didn't understand some commands after one try.

4. ls, cd -l probably the most important to know

5.

pwd- print working directory

ls- list contents of current directory

mv- move this to there

cd- change directory

../- move up one directory

touch- updates access date of file or directory

mkdir- create new directory

less- scroll up page of script

rmdir- delete directory

rm- delete

help- enter an argument or option here something like man, gives suggestions on what is going on

#1.4 Forking and Cloning

**Create a new repository**

This is like creating a new project actually that it exactly what this is doing. You want to give it a name and declare permissions about the repo. First you need to be online on github.com and logged in. In the top right hand corner of the profile click on the addition icon and select create new repository, title it and give it permissions.

**Fork**

Forking a repository is making a copy of an in progress project so that you can work on a copy of it and not the original. That way you can use version control to get the copy where you need it without destroying the original in the process. You must first pull up the repository which you would like to fork from the creators account, the upper left hand title should indicate its current repository location. In the upper right corner of the github website you must look for the  fork icon and the words fork and then click the icon. The upper left hand title should then change to reflect a forked copy with your username in the beginning of the name of the directory.

**Clone**

A clone is a copy of the repository usually after the fork on the local machine this is a command line command. In the terminal change into the directory that you would like for the project to go into and type git clone "copy"

On the github website of the project that you just forked in the mid right hand portion of the website you should see an HTTP site and a box with an address inside. If you clikc the arrow button on the side of this box you will clone that repository. On the command line where you typed git clone paste this address and enter. You should view the clone process and in your current directory should be a copy of the project you have just cloned.

I didn't have many problems setting up git and going through this portion everything was pretty clear. I did learn that after you have forked a repository the title in the upper left hand portion of the screen will change.
