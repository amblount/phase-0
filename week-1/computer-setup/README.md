# U1.W1: Computer Set-Up Instructions

Now that you know a bit about your command line, you can now get your computer set up for DBC!

Unfortunately, there is no magic set up that works for every computer. (Unless you are using a brand new Mac), so expect this challenge to be tricky, especially if you are using a partially set up Mac, a virtual machine for the first time, or a Windows.

There are specific technologies we will need you to have in Phases 0, 1, and 2. We've created instructions for installing each of these in Linux, Mac, and Windows. You may want to review the information you learned in the last challenge about bash while you go through this process. If you are using Windows, the principles should be similar to what was described in *Learning the Bash Shell,* but not exactly the same.

If you have already set up your computer with a dev environment, please make sure you have each of the necessary technologies installed.

NOTE: Some of the commands will change the way your terminal and sublime look, so be prepared. You can always change it back if you would prefer. If you install the dotfiles, it will change your path and overwrite any manual configurations you had.

If you run into installation problems, please join [office hours](https://phase0.devbootcamp.com/office_hours) to ask a guide or request a tutoring session (use the [tutoring request form](http://apply.devbootcamp.com)). Our guides are not experts at computer set up, that is a different skill, but they should help you at least Google your way to a solution. Due to the many differences in environments, it's impossible to create perfect instructions for everyone or even estimate what errors you will run into on your system.

**Unfortunately, Dev Bootcamp does not provide technical support for Windows beyond these instructions. (We all use Macs and many complain about the difficulty of setting up a Windows for programming) If students are interested in learning about how to use a different shell, the learning for that is up to them. The instructors at DBC have most experience with Mac, and we use Macs on site. We highly recommend creating a virtual machine and doing Phase 0 in Linux since the commands are more similar.
