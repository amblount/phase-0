#wireframe reflection

What is a wireframe?
It is a layout of what the website will look like. It can represent what information will occupy more or less space and give an idea about what is important and what is not important.

What are the benefits of wireframing?
Before you actually start building you need to know what information you will need to include.

Did you enjoy wireframing your site?
I feel like with the design layout and the other activities we did so far this week, I feel like I am repeating myself, so not really.

Did you revise your wireframe or stick with your first idea?
Stuck with the first idea. I was able to go over first and second drafts of my design with 2.3 so I did not need to do it again.

What questions did you ask during this challenge?
None, I just looked over the given handouts.

What resources did you find to help you answer them?

Which parts of the challenge did you enjoy and which parts did you find tedious?
I enjoyed thinking about what I was going to build and what information was important.
