<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?
HTML seemed more clear than git which was more abstract, I felt like it was very similar to the code academy session
fiddle

- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
We didn't use much formatting, <hr> we looked up a header underscore indent line

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
following the instructions, no prior knowledge to pull from

- What seems good and bad about HTML?
good: clear, logical
bad: limited not fancy

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
!DOCTYPE html, keeping everything else in the html tags, the rest is standard formatting
