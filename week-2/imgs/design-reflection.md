        What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
        I would like to introduce people to me and some of my interests. I do a lot of research on topics that I am interested in and I think it may be cool for other to read about my reflections to articles that I find and other topics that I think are interesting.

        What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
        I think that my target audience would be my friends and people that I know in tech. These are the people that I think would want to read about me. The site is about me, so...

        What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
        I want the user to select a topic from the the home page which organizes information that I am interested in. The user should then browse the subtopics under their choice and navigate into a folder with an article that they might find interesting to red about it.

        What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
        Design I think is just doing the research so that your product will do the job it was designed to do. A lot of products that are pushed out are not user friendly although they are designed with the user in mind!? User experience takes into account the way that the end user tkes in and s able to find the information presented to them through the design.

        What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
        User experience is how a person feels when using a product. Grea design may lead to a positive emotional experience while bad design will likely lead to a poor user experience.
